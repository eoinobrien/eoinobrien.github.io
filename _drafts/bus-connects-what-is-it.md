Bus Connects is a plan by the National Transport Agency (NTA) to overhaul a number of areas of transportation in Dublin. The plan is made up of 10 distinct plans that all share the same branding. [In the words of the NTA, these are](https://busconnects.ie/about/):
* Building a network of new bus corridors to make journey's faster and more reliable.
* New network of cycle lanes/tracks.
* Redesign of the Dublin area bus network to provide a more efficient network with high frequency spines, new orbital routes and increased bus services.
* Develop a state-of-the-art ticketing system.
* Implementation of a cashless payment system.
* Simpler fare structure.
* New bus stops and shelters with better signage and information
* Provision of bus based Park and Ride sites in key locations.
* New bus livery providing a common style across different operators.
* Transitioning to a new bus fleet with low emission vehicle technologies.

You might know some of these plans from the news, but my goal here is to give a comprehensive list of what each of these plans entails. Some of these plans overlap, but as a whole I tend to think of them as individual plans that would be improved but others being implemented.

## What it isn't

There is a lot of talk about transport in Ireland at the moment thanks to a large period of little to know investment coming to a head. Bus Connects is a part of the Ireland 2040 plan announced in May 2019, but it does not involve anything other than that listed above. While naturally any improvement in other areas of Dublin's public transport will effect the bus network, new transportation projects like Metrolink, Dart improvements or new LUAS lines are not part of the Bus Connect project.

## The plans

### Bus Corridors

The NTA are calling this the [Core Bus Corridor Project](https://busconnects.ie/initiatives/core-bus-corridor-project/) and you might know it from the uproar about trees that are planned to be cut down. <!-- Add links to news articles --> The plan involves creating 16 bus corridors through a combination creating more dedicated bus lanes (by widening streets, or removing car lanes), and/or bus gates.

TODO:

* Examples of implementations in other parts of the world, their success or failures

#### Why cut down trees

#### What are bus gates

### Redesign of the Bus Network



### Improved Cycle Lanes

### Improved Ticketing

When I travel to London, I love how simple it is to travel around the city. Being able to tap a contactless card and continue travelling makes moving about so much easier. Ever get on a bus and realise your Leap card has just dipped below zero, and you have no change.

[Bus Connects includes plans](https://busconnects.ie/initiatives/just-the-ticket/) to both simplify ticketing and the move to a cashless system on buses. The NTA say that the "second biggest source of bus delays, after traffic congestion, is the payment process at bus stops", and anecdotally I know when boarding a bus at busy spots it can take what feels like an age to get to the bus driver to say "â‚¬2.15".

In [November 2019](https://www.thejournal.ie/cashless-payments-on-public-transport-4897407-Nov2019/), the NTA issued a market consulataion for Next Generation Ticketing "to advance the implementation of an Account Based Ticketing (ABT) system across the bus, rail and light rail network". The ABT system includes incorporating open payments allowing for: contactless debit and credit cards (incl. Apple Pay and Google Pay); fare changes, like a 90 minute multi modal fare; QR codes that can be read from an app or paper; electronic tokens and identifiers for concessionary fare products (free travel); alteratives for mobile payments like using a Bluetooth "Be-In Be-Out" model.

### Improved Bus Stops and Signage

You may have already seen the updated signage at bus stops. As part of Go-Ahead operating some routes, the signage at bus stops along those routes needed to be updated.

### Cleaner Fleets

### New Livery

If you have seen a Go-Ahead operated bus you will have already seen this new livery. The buses are predominantly blue and yellow and branded Transport for Ireland. I think the plan is to eventually replace all buses on the network including Dublin Buses with this new livery, but I am unable to find a source on that.

Some fear that a unified bus livery between Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead will allow the NTA to privatise more routes without anyone noticing. <!-- TODO: Learn more about NTA privatisation" -->

The new bus livery will be used on commuter bus services too, with some Go-Ahead operated commuter services in Kildare already sporting the look.

### New Park and Rides

The best way to reduce traffic congestion in Dublin, is to reduce the amount of cars in the city. The NTA want to encourage those who are travelling longer distances to drive part way, but then use public transport to complete their journey.

Building on the current Park and Ride infrastructure around Dublin (like the M3 parkway, or the LUAS Red Cow park and ride), the NTA plan places park and ride facilities on the main corridors into Dublin.

[![Map of Dublin area showing indicative locations of park and ride facilities](/assets/images/indicative-locations-of-park-ride-facilities.png)](/assets/images/indicative-locations-of-park-ride-facilities.png)

The park and ride infrastructure would build on the top of the redesigned bus network and the high frequency bus services along the spines. Parking charges and bus fares would be integrated to allow for seamless connections.
